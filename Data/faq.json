        "question" : "What kind of dyes are these/ what fabrics do they work on?",
        "answer": "<p>These are fiber reactive dyes! They work best on cellulose fibers such as cotton, rayon, modal, hemp, bamboo, linen, etc. They can also be used on wood and protein fibers but the process is different. For protein fibers like silk and wool you'll want to replace soda ash with vinegar or citric acid and use heat during batching.</p>"
    },
    {   "id": "2",
        "question" : "Do I need soda ash?",
        "answer": "<p>Absolutely! Soda ash raises the PH of your item which causes the chemical reaction that allows the dye to penetrate and permanently bond with the fabric. If you skip soda ash your results won't be vibrant. The exception is if you're working with protein fibers, in which case you'll want to use vinegar or citric acid instead.</p>"

        "question" : "Can I add soda ash to your dyes?",
        "answer": "<p>Absolutely! This is a common practice for hot water irrigation and sometimes ice dyers do it too. If you also liquid dye I would recommend not adding your soda ash to the dye directly and doing a soda ash soak instead, or to mix a little at a time in a separate container for hot water irrigation and/or ice dye use.<p>"

        "answer": "<p>You may come across various acronyms, either here or in the Facebook group, although I've tried to keep them to a minimum here. This is what they stand for:<p><ul><li>DOI: Dye Over Ice</li><li>DUI: Dye Under Ice</li><li>SA/SAS: Soda Ash/Soda Ash Soak</li><li>HWI: Hot Water Irrigation</li><li>TDS: Tall Deep Scrunches</li><li>PATS: Pinch And Twist Scrunch </li><li>LWI: Low Water Immersion</li></ul>"

    {   "id": "6",
        "question" : "How much dye powder should I use for ice dye?",
        "answer": "<p>This is going to vary based on your desired look, the size and thickness of your item, how much ice you use etc. A good starting point is to lightly sprinkle it on and add more as needed. You can always add more but you can't remove dye you've already added.</p>"
    },
    {   "id": "7",
        "question" : "How long should I batch for?",
        "answer": "<p>This depends on the ambient temperature and what dye method you chose. If you're doing hot water irrigation, low water immersion, or you finished your ice dye with 150Â° water wait an hour for it to cool down and you can start rinsing! If you're doing ice or liquid with no added heat you can't go wrong waiting 24-48 hours post ice melt. You can also use this system if you know what the ambient temperature of your batching space is:</p>"
    },
    {   "id": "8",
        "question" : "How do I remove the dye?",
        "answer": "<p>Once all of your chosen process and batching steps are complete rinse your still tied item with cold water until it runs almost clear, repeat with hot water, untie and while rinsing in a temperature that's not hot enough to burn you but above lukewarm, then soak your item in hot water with a bit of normal blue dawn/other normal dish soap (don't use the power wash stuff) or textile detergent. Drain when the water cools, repeat until the water is mostly clear. Some people also opt to boil with dish soap/detergent instead. Wash on the longest, hottest cycle.</p>"

        "question" : "What are your hours? ",
        "answer": "<p>They vary, to be honest. I'm in EST,  have ADHD, and am not a morning person so I'm usually getting stuff done between noon and 6pm and from around 10pm to midnight Tuesday - Friday. Some weeks I'm around on Monday, some I'm not, some weeks I'm doing some work (usually shipping labels and a post office run) early in the day on Saturday, some weeks I'm not. </p>"
