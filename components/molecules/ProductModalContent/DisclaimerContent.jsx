    <p className="text-xl">These dyes were formulated with ice dye in mind and use very precise recipes to ensure that the split is consistent. That being said, ice dye itself isn't consistent and your results may be a bit different than mine if you use more or less dye, apply your dye differently, etc. In addition dyes often look different on different fabrics and different fabric weaves.</p>
    <p className="text-xl"> If something on my end changes it will be noted on the dye description and announced in the Happy Cat Tie Dye Facebook Group. Additionally, I haven't tested the liquid colors at all (that may change in the future) so while all of my dyes absolutely work for liquid dyeing I have no idea what most of the shades will be. If you decide to try it out I'd love to see a picture!</p>
    <p className="text-xl">Also some safety things! PLEASE use PPE (at minimum gloves, an N95 mask, and protective eyewear, even better would be a respirator that covers your whole face) while you're working with dye in powder form and soda ash in any form. The dyes are non toxic but in some people an allergic reaction may develop over time if you don't wear protective equipment, and soda ash is caustic. Plus nobody's lungs like fine particles of anything. If you choose not to use to use PPE you do so at your own risk. Please don't skip it though. </p> 
    <p className="text-xl">You can get a full face respirator on Amazon for like $40 and a two pack of cotton lined kitchen gloves for like $10. They'll last for ages. Your health is worth $50. Just saying. </p>
