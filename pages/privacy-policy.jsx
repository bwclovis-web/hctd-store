  <p>We share your Personal Information with service providers to help us provide our services and fulfill our contracts with you, as described above. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We use Shopify to power our online store. You can read more about how Shopify uses your Personal Information here: <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy</a>.</li>
    <li>We may share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.</li>
    {/* <li><i>[INSERT INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS]</i></li> */}
  </ul>

  <h2 className="font-display text-h2-dynamic mt-4">Using Personal Information</h2>
  <p>We use your personal Information to provide our services to you, which includes: offering products for sale, processing payments, shipping and fulfillment of your order, and keeping you up to date on new products, services, and offers.</p>
  <h3 className="font-display text-h2-dynamic mt-4">Lawful basis</h3>
  <p>Pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), if you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we process your personal information under the following lawful bases:</p>
  {/* <p><i>[INCLUDE ALL THAT APPLY TO YOUR BUSINESS]</i></p> */}
  <ul>

    <li>Compliance with our legal obligations;</li>
    <li>To protect your vital interests;</li>
    <li>To perform a task carried out in the public interest;</li>
