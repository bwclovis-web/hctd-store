  <h1 className="font-display text-h2-dynamic">Shipping Policy</h1>
  <p>I do my best to get your order into your hands as fast as possible! Typical turnaround time for me to ship an order is 1-3 business days but I'm only one person and stuff happens so it could ship as fast as same day or take up to a week if I have a high order volume.</p>
  <p>If your order will take longer than a week to ship or something you ordered is temporarily out of stock I will contact you to let you know.</p>
  <p>Once your package ships it's in the hands of the shipping gods and there's nothing I can do about how long that takes. You will receive a tracking number and if your package is truly lost (not delayed) I will replace it. </p>
  <p>That's super rare though, usually package delivery is fast and easy.</p>

  <h2 className="font-display text-h3-dynamic mt-16">*International shipping</h2> 

  <p>I am located in the United States and I will happily ship anywhere in the world that country regulations allow me to ship.</p> 
  <p>Please familiarize yourself with your country's international shipping and customs policies and fees so there are no surprises. </p>
