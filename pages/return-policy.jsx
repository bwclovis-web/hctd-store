    <p>At this time I do not do returns/refunds. I'm only one person and it's too much to keep track of.</p>

    <h2 className="font-display text-h3-dynamic mt-16">For dyes:</h2> 
    <p>If I made a mistake and sent you the wrong color, forgot something, or something arrived damaged please send a picture and I will replace it free of charge. This is rare but if it does happen I will make it right. </p>

    <h2 className="font-display text-h3-dynamic mt-16">For clothing:</h2> 
    <p>If I accidentally send you the wrong thing I will exchange it for the correct thing. I include sizes and measurements on each listing and do my best to make sure the colors are as accurate as possible. Colors may look different from screen to screen and you are responsible for taking your own measurements to determine fit.</p>
